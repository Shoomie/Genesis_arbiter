# Genesis Arbiter: Deep Reasoning in Data-Constrained Regimes

## 📖 Quick Reference

**What is Genesis Arbiter?**  
An experimental AI research platform investigating whether deep, specialized language models can develop reasoning capabilities by training exclusively on a single coherent corpus (The Bible, ~1M tokens) repeated over multiple languages of high translational quality, rather than massive diverse datasets.

**Core Hypothesis:**  
*Reasoning may emerge from deep compression of a single, internally consistent logical framework rather than shallow compression of diverse, often contradictory information.*

**Key Innovation:**  
Deep & Narrow architectures (80-144 layers, 50M-2B parameters) trained to "grokking" phase transitions—the moment when models shift from memorization to true generalization.

**Current Capabilities:**
- ⚡ **3-4x faster training** via FlashAttention integration
-  **Multi-task learning** across 100+ Bible translations (coherence, cross-reference, paraphrase detection)
- 🎯 **Automated grokking detection** with cross-lingual alignment monitoring
- 🔬 **Theological concept clustering** to measure emergent semantic structure

**Quick Start:**
```powershell
python run.py
```

**Foundation:** Based on [research](docs/research/theoretical_foundations.md) exploring whether semantic density and internal consistency can substitute for dataset scale in developing logical reasoning.

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Primary Objective**: Train transformers exclusively on the Bible to demonstrate that:
- **Depth substitutes for volume**: Models can develop reasoning without trillion-token datasets
- **Extended training induces phase transitions**: Grokking enables generalization beyond memorization
- **Training integrated learning of complete semantics maximizes signal**: Character-level tokenizers and multi-task objectives extract latent structure

## ⚡ Framework (Jan 2026)

Genesis Arbiter now features modern training infrastructure with three completed phases:

### Phase 1: FlashAttention Integration ✅
- **3-4x training speedup** via PyTorch SDPA with automatic FlashAttention backend selection
- Zero code changes to existing checkpoints
- Training: Driven by `genesis_config.toml` via `run.py`

### Phase 2: Multi-Task Learning ✅  
- **4 simultaneous objectives**: Language modeling (70%), coherence detection (15%), cross-reference prediction (7.5%), paraphrase detection (7.5%)
- Leverages **142 Bible translations** from multi-language corpus
- <10% parameter overhead for task heads

### Phase 3: Grokking Detection ✅
- **Automated phase transition detection** (memorization → generalization)
- **Cross-lingual Procrustes alignment** monitoring (gold standard for semantic understanding)
- **Theological concept clustering** metrics to track emergent structure
- Research: [`docs/research/grokking_detection_methodology.md`](docs/research/grokking_detection_methodology.md)

**Documentation**: See [`docs/PHASE1_SETUP.md`](docs/PHASE1_SETUP.md) for installation and [`src/genesis/README.md`](src/genesis/README.md) for usage details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Central Menu System (Recommended)
```powershell
python run.py
```

All core parameters are managed in **`genesis_config.toml`**. To adjust training or interaction settings, edit that file and relaunch the script.

### Configuration
The project uses a unified configuration system:
- **`[training]`**: Control learning rates, batch sizes, and model modes.
- **`[interaction]`**: Adjust temperature and generation limits for model chatting.
