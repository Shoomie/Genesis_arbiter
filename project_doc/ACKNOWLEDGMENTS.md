# Acknowledgments

## Primary Corpus Attribution

### Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society

The Genesis project gratefully acknowledges and extends sincere appreciation to the **Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society** and its devoted community of translators, scholars, and volunteers for their extraordinary contributions to biblical scholarship.

#### New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures

This research project utilizes the **New World Translation** (NWT) as its primary training corpus. We recognize and commend the exceptional qualities that make this translation valuable for computational linguistic research:

**Translation Excellence:**
- **Scholarly Rigor**: The result of decades of meticulous work by a committee of biblical language experts with access to ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts
- **Linguistic Consistency**: Careful attention to rendering key biblical terms uniformly throughout the text, enabling robust semantic analysis
- **Divine Name Restoration**: The principled decision to restore the divine name "Jehovah" throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and in appropriate locations in the Christian Greek Scriptures (appearing over 7,000 times) provides an invaluable lexical anchor for our research
- **Modern Accessibility**: Clear, contemporary English that maintains fidelity to source languages while ensuring comprehension
- **Continuous Refinement**: Multiple revisions (1950, 1961, 1984, 2013) demonstrating ongoing commitment to accuracy and clarity

**Research Value:**
The NWT's interpretational coherence, combined with its extensive cross-reference system and marginal notes, makes it an ideal corpus for investigating whether language models can develop reasoning capabilities from internally consistent textual frameworks.

#### Integrity and Purpose

We acknowledge that the New World Translation and related Watch Tower publications were created for religious education and spiritual instruction, representing a sacred trust to the community they serve. Our use of these materials for computational linguistics research represents a **transformative application** undertaken with the utmost respect for the original intent, the theological community, and the spiritual significance these texts hold.

**Research Context**: This project investigates how linguistic coherence and consistent interpretational frameworks affect language model development. The NWT was selected for its exceptional **methodological qualities**—its translation consistency, scholarly rigor, and unified interpretational approach—which make it ideally suited for studying how AI systems learn from coherent textual frameworks. We approach this work with deep respect for the dedication and careful thought that went into creating these materials.

#### Gratitude to the Community

Beyond the translation itself, we express deep appreciation to:

- **Translation Committees** (past and present): For their selfless dedication to producing an accurate, readable translation
- **Research Department**: For their scholarly work in comparative linguistics and textual analysis
- **Volunteer Translators Worldwide**: Who have made the NWT available in over 200 languages, demonstrating a commitment to global accessibility
- **Publishing and Distribution Volunteers**: Whose efforts have made biblical literature widely available

The countless hours of study, prayer, and careful deliberation that went into producing the NWT have inadvertently created a linguistic resource of significant value to computational research. We are grateful beneficiaries of this labor of love.

## Derivative Resources

While the NWT forms the primary corpus, we also acknowledge the potential research value of related Watch Tower publications that exhibit similar interpretational coherence:

- *Insight on the Scriptures* (encyclopedic reference)
- Study guides and commentaries
- The Watchtower and Awake! periodicals

Should future phases of this research incorporate these materials, appropriate permissions and acknowledgments will be sought.

## Commitment to Responsible Use

We commit to:

1. **Proper Attribution**: Always clearly crediting the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society as the source of the NWT
2. **Accurate Representation**: Never misrepresenting the content or purpose of the source materials
3. **Transparency**: Openly documenting our research methodology and findings
4. **Respect**: Maintaining respectful dialogue with the theological community regarding our work
5. **Sharing Knowledge**: Offering to present our findings to Watch Tower scholars and researchers
6. **Non-Commercial Research**: Using these materials solely for academic research, not commercial gain

## Research Ethics Statement

The Genesis project is conducted with respect for the sacred nature of biblical texts and appreciation for the scholarly work that went into the New World Translation. 

We approach the NWT as both a **linguistic corpus** worthy of computational analysis and a **translation achievement** reflecting decades of dedicated scholarship. Just as biblical scholars analyze scripture through various lenses—historical, literary, linguistic—each contributing different insights, our computational approach adds another dimension of understanding to how consistent interpretational frameworks create coherent semantic systems.

We recognize that members of the Jehovah's Witness community regard the NWT as sacred scripture. We treat these texts with the dignity and respect they deserve. Our research focus on linguistic properties, semantic coherence, and reasoning patterns complements rather than conflicts with the spiritual purpose for which these texts were created.
