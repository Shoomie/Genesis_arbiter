# Genesis Arbiter: Prepared Data Artifacts

This directory contains serialized binary artifacts used by the research pipelines to accelerate training and enable advanced masking strategies in the pure byte-level regime.

## 📄 Artifacts

### `genesis_boundaries.pt`
**Whole-Word Masking (WWM) Boundary Map**

- **Format**: PyTorch Tensor (`torch.uint8`)
- **Generated by**: `tools/generate_boundary_map.py`
- **Purpose**: Defines the starting positions of "words" (logical units) within the byte-level corpus. 
- **Usage**: Referenced by the `GenesisTrainer` during training to ensure that entire words are masked as a single unit, rather than random bytes, which significantly improves causal reasoning performance.

**Regime**: Pure Byte-Level UTF-8 (Vocab: 260)
